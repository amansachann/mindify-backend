- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Use services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Firebase Storage for handling file uploads.

### 6. **Notifications**

- **Real-time Notifications**: Notify users when a note is shared with them or when a comment is added.
- **Email Notifications**: Notify users about important events (password change, new note shared, etc.).

### 7. **Data Security**

- **Encryption**: Store sensitive information like passwords securely using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
- **Data Validation**: Ensure proper validation and sanitization of incoming data (e.g., email format, note content).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of API requests from a user in a given time period.
- **API Throttling**: Prevent excessive usage of the API by the same user.

### 8. **API Endpoints**

Here’s an overview of API endpoints you might have:

- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Login and get an authentication token.
- **POST /api/auth/forgot-password**: Forgot password.
- **POST /api/auth/reset-password**: Reset password using token.
- **GET /api/notes**: Get all notes for the logged-in user.
- **POST /api/notes**: Create a new note.
- **GET /api/notes/:id**: Get a specific note by ID.
- **PUT /api/notes/:id**: Update an existing note.
- **DELETE /api/notes/:id**: Delete a note.
- **POST /api/notes/search**: Search notes by title or content.
- **POST /api/notes/share**: Share a note with another user.
- **GET /api/notes/tags**: Get a list of tags for the user.
- **POST /api/notes/tag**: Add tags to a note.
- **PUT /api/user/profile**: Update user profile.
- **POST /api/user/logout**: Logout user.

### 9. **Analytics and Metrics**

- **Usage Statistics**: Track how many notes the user has, how often they’re accessing their notes, etc.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Record how often notes are shared or commented on.

### 10. **Database Models**

- **User Model**: Store user data (name, email, password hash, etc.).
- **Note Model**: Store note data (user ID, title, content, tags, categories, timestamp).
- **Shared Notes Model**: Store shared note information (user ID, note ID, permissions).
- **Comment Model**: Store comments on notes (user ID, note ID, content, timestamp).
- **File Model**: Store file attachments related to notes (file path, note ID).

### 11. **Scalability and Performance**

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for retrieving notes, especially if the user has many.
- **Caching**: Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to speed up frequently accessed data (like search results).

### 12. **Testing and Documentation**

- **Unit and Integration Tests**: Ensure your API functions as expected with tools like Jest or Mocha.
- **API Documentation**: Document your API using tools like Swagger for easy reference by developers.
