Here are the backend functionalities for implementing **authentication and authorization**, classified as **Basic** and **Advanced**:

---

### **1. Basic Backend Functionalities**
These cover the essential backend tasks for a functional and secure authentication system.

#### **User Registration**
- Create a user account with:
  - Input validation (email and password).
  - Email uniqueness check.
  - Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).

#### **User Login**
- Authenticate user:
  - Verify email and password.
  - Generate JWT or create a session upon successful login.
- Return tokens (JWT or session ID) to the client.

#### **Logout**
- Invalidate the session:
  - Remove session data from the server.
  - Clear client-side JWT or cookies.

#### **Authorization**
- Middleware to check:
  - User is authenticated (e.g., validate JWT or session).
  - Protect routes from unauthorized access.

#### **Password Management**
- Implement password reset:
  - Generate and store a password reset token.
  - Validate the token and update the password upon user request.

#### **Token Management**
- Set expiration for tokens.
- Securely store session data (e.g., in Redis for scalability).

#### **Security**
- Rate limiting for login attempts.
- Account lock after multiple failed attempts.
- Ensure all communication uses HTTPS.

### **2. Advanced Backend Functionalities**
These enhance the authentication and authorization system's security, scalability, and features.

#### **User Registration**
- CAPTCHA integration to prevent bot sign-ups.
- Email verification:
  - Generate and send a one-time email verification token.
  - Validate the token and activate the user account.

#### **User Login**
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):
  - Generate and validate one-time passcodes (e.g., sent via email or SMS).
- Monitor login attempts:
  - Log suspicious login patterns (e.g., IP changes, device changes).

#### **Logout**
- Token revocation:
  - Maintain a blacklist for revoked JWTs.
  - Invalidate all user sessions when they log out globally.

#### **Authorization**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - Define roles (e.g., Admin, User) and assign them to users.
  - Middleware to enforce role-based permissions.
- Permission-Based Access Control (PBAC):
  - Define granular permissions for actions (e.g., read, write, delete).
  - Middleware to enforce action-level permissions.

#### **Password Management**
- Log password change events.
- Notify users of password updates or failed reset attempts.

#### **Token Management**
- Refresh tokens:
  - Issue short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens.
  - Implement an endpoint for token refresh.
- Token rotation:
  - Issue a new token on each use to reduce exposure.

#### **Email and Notifications**
- Send notifications for:
  - Suspicious login attempts.
  - Account changes (e.g., password reset, email updates).

#### **Monitoring and Logging**
- Log user activity (e.g., login, logout, failed attempts).
- Implement alerting for suspicious patterns (e.g., multiple failed logins).

#### **Compliance**
- Implement account deletion features to comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- Provide APIs for exporting or deleting user data.

#### **API Security**
- Validate all inputs server-side to prevent SQL injection or XSS.
- Implement CORS policies for backend APIs.

### **Summary**
The **Basic** functionalities form the foundation, while the **Advanced** functionalities add scalability, security, and compliance features.
