- `password` (Hashed password)

#### **Metadata**

- `updatedAt` (Timestamp for the last update to the account)

#### **Status**
- `isActive` (Boolean to indicate if the account is active or verified)

### **2. Advanced User Fields**
These fields enhance functionality, scalability, and security.

#### **Identification & Authentication**
- `username` (Optional field for a unique username)
- `phone` (Optional phone number for multi-factor authentication)
- `authProvider` (E.g., `local`, `google`, `facebook` for social logins)
