# Project Stages

To divide the features into **Basic Functionality** and **Advanced Features**, here's how you could structure the development process for your note-taking application:

### **1. Basic Functionality**
These are the core features that allow the app to function as a simple note-taking application. They form the essential part of the app's MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

#### **User Authentication and Authorization**
- **Register User**: Create a user with email and password.
- **Login User**: Authenticate user and issue JWT or session.
- **Logout User**: Implement logout functionality (remove JWT or session).

#### **Note Management**
- **Create Note**: Add a new note with title and content.
- **Get All Notes**: Retrieve all notes associated with the logged-in user.
- **Get Note by ID**: Fetch a specific note by its ID.
- **Update Note**: Edit the content or title of an existing note.
- **Delete Note**: Delete a specific note.
- **Search Notes**: Basic search functionality (search by title or content).
  
#### **Note Settings**
- **Pin Notes**: Mark important notes to appear at the top of the list.
- **Archive Notes**: Archive notes that are not needed frequently but should be stored.
- **Favorite Notes**: Mark notes as favorites for easier access.

#### **API Endpoints for Basic Functionality**
- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Login a user.
- **GET /api/notes**: Retrieve all notes.
- **POST /api/notes**: Create a new note.
- **GET /api/notes/:id**: Retrieve a specific note.
- **PUT /api/notes/:id**: Update a note.
- **DELETE /api/notes/:id**: Delete a note.
- **POST /api/notes/search**: Basic search for notes.

### **2. Advanced Features**
These features can be added after the basic functionalities are implemented. They will enhance the appâ€™s usability, collaboration, and user experience.

#### **User Authentication and Authorization (Advanced)**
- **Password Reset**: Allow users to reset their passwords via email.
- **Email Verification**: Confirm user emails after registration.
- **Profile Management**: Let users update their profile (username, email, etc.).

#### **Note Management (Advanced)**
- **Tagging Notes**: Allow users to categorize notes with tags for better organization and searchability.
- **Note Categories**: Let users create custom categories for their notes (e.g., Work, Personal).
- **Share Notes**: Allow users to share notes with other users via email or user ID.
- **Commenting on Notes**: Let users comment on their own or shared notes.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Enable real-time collaboration on shared notes using websockets (e.g., Socket.io).

#### **File Attachments and Media**
- **Attach Files**: Allow users to upload files (images, PDFs) to their notes.
- **Preview Files**: Show file previews within the note (e.g., display images, PDFs).

#### **Notifications**
- **Real-time Notifications**: Notify users when notes are shared, commented on, or edited.
- **Email Notifications**: Send notifications about important events (password changes, shared notes, etc.).

#### **Data Security and Performance**
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect the API from abuse by limiting the number of requests in a time frame.
- **Data Encryption**: Use encryption methods to store sensitive data, like passwords (bcrypt).
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., Redis for searches).

#### **API Endpoints for Advanced Features**
- **POST /api/auth/forgot-password**: Initiate password reset process.
- **POST /api/auth/reset-password**: Reset user password with token.
- **POST /api/notes/tag**: Add tags to a note.
- **POST /api/notes/share**: Share a note with another user.
- **POST /api/notes/comment**: Add a comment to a note.
- **GET /api/notes/tags**: Get a list of all tags for the user.
- **POST /api/notes/file-upload**: Upload files to attach to a note.
